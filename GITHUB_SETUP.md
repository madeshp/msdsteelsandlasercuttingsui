# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since GitHub CLI is not available in this environment, please follow these steps to create a GitHub repository and push your code:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `msd-steel-react`
   - **Description**: `Modern React conversion of MSD Steel and Laser Cuttings website with EmailJS integration`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/msd-steel-react.git

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all the files including:
   - React project structure
   - Images in `public/images/`
   - Updated README.md
   - Package.json with dependencies

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/msd-steel-react.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Repository Status

Your local repository is ready with:
- ✅ Initial React project setup
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Images copied from original project
- ✅ Comprehensive README documentation
- ✅ Proper .gitignore file
- ✅ Two commits with descriptive messages

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. Set up EmailJS service (see README.md for details)
2. Continue with React component development
3. Test the contact form functionality
4. Deploy to Netlify/Vercel when ready

## Repository URL Format

Your repository will be available at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/msd-steel-react`
